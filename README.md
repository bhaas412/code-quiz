# Code Quiz

## Description
This project is a timed coding quiz application that utilizes JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML/CSS. The app will prompt the user with questions regarding Javascript fundamentals. Correct answers award 1 point and incorrect answers take 10 seconds off the clock. The quiz ends when either all questions have been answered or the time is up. The user will then be able to enter their initials and store their high score in local storage.

App functionality was completed with JS by utilizing the HTML DOM and Web APIs. Event handling was also required to dynamically update the screens/questions/etc.
